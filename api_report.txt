## API Modules

The following API modules are located in `src/services/`:

- `api.ts`
- `authService.ts`
- `categoryApi.ts`
- `movieApi.ts`
- `seriesApi.ts`
- `tvChannelApi.ts`

### 1. api.ts
**Purpose:**
Provides a base configuration for making HTTP requests to the backend server. It typically sets up an Axios instance with default headers, base URL, and interceptors for handling requests and responses.

**Usage:**
All other API modules use this base instance to ensure consistent communication with the backend.

---

### 2. authService.ts

Handles user authentication, including login, logout, and token management.

**Main Functions:**
- `login(credentials)`: Sends user credentials to the backend and receives an authentication token.
- `logout()`: Clears user session and tokens.
- `getCurrentUser()`: Retrieves the current authenticated user's information.

**Usage:**
Used in authentication flows and protected routes to manage user sessions.

### 3. categoryApi.ts
**Purpose:**
Manages requests related to content categories (e.g., genres, channel groups).

**Main Functions:**
- `getCategories()`: Fetches a list of available categories from the backend.
- `getCategoryDetails(id)`: Retrieves details for a specific category.

**Usage:**

Handles requests for movie data.

**Main Functions:**
- `getMovies()`: Fetches a list of movies.
- `getMovieDetails(id)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific movie.
- `searchMovies(query)`: Searches for movies based on user input.

## How APIs Work in the Project

- All API modules use the base configuration from `api.ts` for consistent HTTP requests.
- Authentication is managed via `authService.ts`, ensuring secure access to protected resources.
- Content APIs (`categoryApi.ts`, `movieApi.ts`, `seriesApi.ts`, `tvChannelApi.ts`) fetch and manage data for their respective sections of the app.
- Data fetched from APIs is used to render pages, display details, and provide search/filter functionality.

---

## Notes
- API endpoints and URLs are configured in `src/config/apiConfig.ts`.
- Error handling and loading states are managed in the UI components.
